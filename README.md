xampp-control
=============

Easy managing directory's and ports for mysql and apache in xampp

The base was written by Jono Bacon (jono@jonobacon.org). There weren't enough options for me.
The most important feature is to change the Documentroot in Apache. his wil make it a lot easier to use it for development purposes.

I hope to clean up some code soon and add some features like beside the gtk-ui, a qt-ui.
